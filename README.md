# Visual Studio Code Background

This is my collection of Visual Studio Code background which originally stored within this [repository](https://github.com/UnknownRori/dotfiles/tree/master/vscode/background), but since it will make that repository bloated so I decided to seperate this two thing, but how to add this background will be still on that repository.

I need to warn you that loading some background (especially with file extension .gif) might cause your Visual Studio Code running like a turtle, only on load but if it fully load it will barely cause any performance issue.
